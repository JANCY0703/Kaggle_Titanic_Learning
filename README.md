# Kaggle_Titanic_Learning
最近，我在学习Kaggle的入门赛Titanic，由于Kaggle中的notebook均为英文，学习起来不太方便，因此我将notebook翻译为中文并对代码进行了复现，且加上了自己的注释，方便阅读。

Recently, I was studying Titanic, Kaggle's introductory competition. Since the notebooks in Kaggle are all in English, it is not convenient to learn, so I translated the notebook into Chinese and reproduced the code, and added my own notes.
